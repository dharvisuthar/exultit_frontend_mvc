                            <br />
                            <p class="col_about_p">
                                The e-com services between businesses and consumers can be classified broadly in the following four categories:
                            </p>
                            <p class="text_bold"> Business-to-Consumers (B2C)</p>
                            <p class="col_about_p ">
                                The most common type of business transaction involves selling products and services to individual consumers. For e.g. - Buying a t-shirt from an online store.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text_bold"> Business-to-Business (B2B)</p>
                            <p class="col_about_p ">
                                Providing goods and services to other businesses falls under the category of B2B. For e.g. - our professional team developing an eCommerce website for your business.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text_bold">Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)</p>
                            <p class="col_about_p ">
                                Consumers selling their previously purchased items to another consumer. For e.g. – an individual selling their used watch on eBay.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text_bold"> Business-to-Business (B2B)</p>
                            <p class="col_about_p ">
                                When an individual provides value in the form of goods and services to businesses, it falls under the category of C2B. For e.g. – Blogger providing an affiliate link to a product in exchange for a fixed commission.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6 col_about col_about-mobile-div">

                            An online store can deal according to any of these eCommerce models. Based on the type of your business, your e-com platform can take up a variety of forms to offer transactions under categories such as:
                        </p>
                        <p class="col_about_p "><li>Retail, </li></p>
