                            <p class="col_about_p">Every time you face a doubt, where do you turn to? </p>
                            <p class="col_about_p">GOOGLE. </p>
                            <p class="col_about_p">Guess what. </p>
                            <p class="col_about_p">Most individuals and businesses rely on Google too. In this era of people becoming habitants of the virtual world, it is obvious that a brand needs to have a significant online presence to survive. </p>
                            <p class="col_about_p">In order to exist online, you need to devise a marketing strategy which can boost your reach and generate leads substantially. One of the major marketing formula to implement is <span class="text_bold">Search Engine Optimization</span> (SEO). This simply means using the right words in the right place. </p>
                            <p class="col_about_p">Obviously, things are not as simple as that. </p>

                        <p class="text_bold">What is SEO? </p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">Search Engine Optimization is all about knowing and implementing what can make your website visible. It focuses on attracting visitors organically by ranking higher in Google searches. This can be achieved through optimizing your website and content according to several factors that affect the rankings. </p>
                        <p class="text_bold">Why is ranking high on search engines important for your website?</p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">Every day more than 3 billion searches are made on Google alone for SEO. This means there must be hundreds and thousands of people searching for answers every second that are relevant to your business. So for all the time you are not ranked high on Google, you miss out on visitors, leads, and eventually, money. </p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">By optimizing your site according to the relevant keywords, you can tap into the enormous potential which the Internet offers for your business. This also ensures a smooth user experience for your new visitors as well as existing customers. </p>
                        <p class="text_bold">What are we going to offer? </p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">We know how valuable customers are for your business. To make yourself visible amidst the chaos, your online presence requires clear planning and implementation of multiple strategies. This can boost your visibility on the Internet and significantly increase your sales too. </p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">Always remember that SEO is not just for ranking higher on the search engines. It is also aimed at providing a better user experience for everybody that visits your website.  </p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">At <span class="text_bold">Exult IT Solutions</span>, we have a team of professionals with years of experience in the field of digital marketing. Our experts have worked with several brands and businesses to provide them with effective marketing solutions. The plans and strategies are made after we conduct an in-depth analysis of your business, requirements as well as your customer base. This rigorous research enables us to understand what is required and what exactly do your business needs. </p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">Our SEO strategy is planned by experts and involves all the necessary procedures to rank your website higher in the relevant Google searches. This includes two major components:-</p>
                        <p class="text_bold">On-Page Optimization</p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">As the name goes, this includes all the adjustments and modifications made on the website. This is inarguably the most visible aspect of SEO. A website has several elements that significantly impact the visitor’s decision-making as well as their user experience.</p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">A major part of the on-page SEO includes optimizing content available on your website. This requires keyword research, optimized titles, meta descriptions, and tags. Several other features such as improving URLs, images, creating internal and external links also require modification. </p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">Having a great website is useless at the end of the day if it does not performs well. Loading speed is an important thing to keep in mind while doing on-page optimization. </p>
                        <p class="text_bold">Off-Page Optimization</p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">Off-page optimization goes beyond the work done on the website. This strategy includes building your brand’s credibility by generating enough backlinks on various reputed websites and platforms. When users come across your web link on a reputable website, it would create their trust in your brand. </p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">Google does not entertain spam redirects to your website and one should always avoid this. Thus, creating relevant backlinks requires proper research and analysis. These links should be optimized according to subject relevance, anchor text, link location, etc.</p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">A brand can take advantage of this strategy using social media, emails, guest blogging, and much more. This way you can reach a wider audience without sending out spam links to attract visitors to your website.</p>
                        <p class="text_bold">Our services also include:</p>
                        <p class="text_bold">Mobile Optimization </p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">Mobile phone users have been on a meteoric rise in the past few years and almost every other person is connected to the Internet through this small device. Statistically, around 91% of the Internet users have mobile phones to go online every day. </p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">Due to this increase, Google has started ranking websites based on their mobile-friendliness too. A website is not good enough if it does not respond well to mobile phones. Therefore a good website should be responsive to modern smartphones. </p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">Mobile optimization requires a few basic steps:-</p>
                        <p class="col_about_p"><li>Use a ‘responsive’ theme for your website. Nowadays, most templates and themes available online are suitable for mobile phones. </li></p>
                        <p class="col_about_p"><li>The graphics used should not be too large in size. Unnecessarily large files take more time to load on phones and this could decrease user retention on your site.  </li></p>
                        <p class="col_about_p"><li>Clickable links and buttons should be added properly keeping in mind the small screen of mobile phones. </li></p>
                        <p class="text_bold">Technical SEO</p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">Like every other technology, websites too can have some technical glitches. These obstacles while using the website potentially destroy your reputation and thus, affects your customer base. </p>
                        <p class="col_about_p">The term Technical SEO refers to website optimization according to crawlers and web index. A proper technical SEO can ensure that the website is smoothly indexed by the search engines, preferably Google. This includes optimizing the URL structure, adding an SSL certificate and HTTPS, better website speed, registration with webmaster tools, etc. </p>
