                            <p class="col_about_p">
                                Cloud services are offered by a number of cloud service providers on the Internet. These are fully managed by the service providers so that the companies do not need to store data and programs on their servers.
                            </p>

                            <p class="col_about_p">
                                These services utilize a huge bunch of servers spread across different locations which makes the allocation and reallocation of resources fast.

                                As its use can easily be modified as required, using a cloud service is cost-effective as compared to storing and accessing data through physical storage.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text_bold">Easy to manage</p>

                                Taking a subscription to a cloud service is not a permanent association. It can be procured on-demand and you can easily cancel the service if you do not need it anymore. This makes it easier for the buyers to handle the services according to their requirements.

                            In order to manage SaaS tools, many service providers require an infrastructure that is offered by IaaS service providers. Some of the giants of cloud-based services such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc. offer such services.
